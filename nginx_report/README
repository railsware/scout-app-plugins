* Description

This is a Scout (http://scoutapp.com) plugin that monitors nginx and 
sends the data back to scout.

In order to have this plugin running, you need to make sure that your 
version of Nginx was compiled with the Stub Status module.

On Ubuntu Hardy, the nginx package comes with Stub Status compiled in so 
if you installed Nginx via apt-get or aptitude, you should have it.

Make sure you have the following in your nginx config file:

location /nginx_status {
	stub_status on;
	access_log   off;
	allow 127.0.0.1;
	deny all;
}

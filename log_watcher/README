Log Watcher Plugin
=================================
Created by [Yaroslav Lazor](http://github.com/yaroslavlazor)

Tail the difference(from the last run) of the log file and execute it through:
- a pipe - to get a single value
- and error pipe - to get a error body for the alert message

Simple scenario:
 just write a "grep 'error' | wc -l" pipe, which will report amount of errors

Complex Example scenario:
 you have a file /var/log/some.log

 a service write the follogin data into it
   2009-10-29 15:49:35 SendEmail qid=77 thread: 3 completed: 4 of 4 time: 759

 or a following error message :
   2009-10-29 16:13:37 SendEmail qid=77 thread=7 org.apache.commons.mail.EmailException: Sending the email to the following server failed : xx.xx.xx.xx:25
 
 You can create two pipes. 
 Value pipe that will count the difference between completed: x of y 
   egrep -o "completed: [0-9]+ of [0-9]+" | awk '{split($0,vars," ");sum=sum+vars[4]-vars[2]}END{print sum}'
 Output : number of non-completed items

 Error pipe that will grep for "org.apache.commons.mail.EmailException" and show a uniq amount of errors
   grep "org.apache.commons.mail.EmailException:" | awk '{gsub(/^....-..-.. ..:..:../,"date");gsub(/thread=[0-9]+/,"thread=x");print $0}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr 
 Output : concatenated errors in unified format, date and thread number less
